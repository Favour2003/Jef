Jeffery is boss
He's got drip hot as sause
Ma guy so cool, cool enough to freeze mars
I'm spitting bars 
but my bars got no chance against his cars
I'm counting years, he's counting arse
Jeffery got no fillers cause
he's the boss

and I think I'm the cause.()

Jeff isn't 'boss'
Favour sells me too high
let's even discuss,
about this cool guy
as you might have figured,
the rhymes span two lines
and froz,
ma guy's just too nice

# I got tired ðŸ‘¾

guy, you're the boss
those lines don't lie
you just spit rhymes hot as sause
yet you say you don't qualify
aight imma let that fly
but that's not gonna nullify 
the fact that I think you deny and oversimplify
the way you make your lines sly
but I'm a gemini
I always see this shii like bull's eye
you say you ain't boss and I sell you too high
if so, explain to me why your rhymes be delicious as apple pie

# mike drop, but it drops on my feet and I scream in pain
#I dont know what I'm doing man :)
