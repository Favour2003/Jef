Jeffery is boss
He's got drip hot as sause
Ma guy so cool, cool enough to freeze mars
I'm spitting bars 
but my bars got no chance against his cars
I'm counting years, he's counting arse
Jeffery got no fillers cause
he's the boss

and I think I'm the cause.()

Jeff isn't 'boss'
Favour sells me too high
let's even discuss,
about this cool guy
as you might have figured,
the rhymes span two lines
and froz,
ma guy's just too nice

# I got tired ðŸ‘¾
